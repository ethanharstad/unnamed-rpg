{{< link "docs/characters/god" >}} is a product of the {{< link "docs/factions/technologists" >}} experimenting on unwilling cyborgs.
Many of the prior attempts perished because of incompatibility with the serum being given.

The technological civilization was cruel with how they treated these people and forced the other cyborgs to watch as each experiment failed to get the desired outcome, an obedient being that can do their bidding against other civilizations and wage war.
The prior failed experiments that survived would have an element attached to them like the God does, but it would be weak in comparison.
The researchers saw that injecting combinations of previous serums had a much higher chance of creating a viable host and also amplified their power.
Failed experiments will act as bosses throughout the story and each will have an element to wield but in a much weaker state.
The God died during the experiment and their body was disposed of.
