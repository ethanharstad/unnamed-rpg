{{< link "docs/characters/god" >}} was a failed experiment that died during experiments by {{< link "docs/factions/technologists" >}} (see {{< link "docs/story/prelude/experimentation" >}}) but one of their elements was Life, which gave them the ability to self resurrect.
They then broke out of the technological compound and teleported away using their space element.
They ended up finding groups of people that were very anti technology and these new people treated them as a deity, creating the {{< link "docs/factions/theocracy" >}}.
The followers of God are unaware that they were a cyborg.
The God learned to understand and control their power and then transmitted their magic into vessels to be used to wage their revenge against the technological civilization.
The term vessel can be anything, living or not.
These vessels became the army/weapons of the theocracy.
