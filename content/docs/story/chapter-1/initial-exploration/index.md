{{< link "docs/characters/main" >}} is exploring and looting the newly discovered {{< link "docs/places/origin-ruins" >}} outside of {{< link "docs/places/origin-city" >}} with {{< link "docs/characters/companion-1" >}} and {{< link "docs/characters/companion-2" >}}.
An out of place rock was blown up by dynamite which revealed an escape hatch that led down to an old research station for the {{< link "docs/factions/technologists" >}}.
As the group delve down into the ruins they note that there is a damaged transformer next to the entrance near the hatch (damaged by the dynamite) and that there is electrical power running through the place and there is powered lights guiding the way.
The lights though are red because the ruins are now running on reserve power due to the damage sustained to the transformer.
The group is scrounging for anything that might be of value to the group, they find some interesting relics and then leave and go back to town and vow to come back another day to continue looting.
