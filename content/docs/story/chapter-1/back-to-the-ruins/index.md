A month later the party is approached by {{< link "docs/characters/companion-3" >}} who joins the party of {{< link "docs/characters/main" >}}, {{< link "docs/characters/companion-1" >}}, and {{< link "docs/characters/companion-2" >}}.
They all decide to go back to {{< link "docs/places/origin-ruins" >}}.

They are almost there when immediately they can tell that the place looks absolutely nothing like it did on the first trip here.
They can see buildings that were not there along with entire corridors that seem to have appeared out of thin air.
These buildings were hidden due to the holographic projector and forcefield and now it resembles a traditional research area.
A lot of what they had touched was obviously moved as if someone else had been there.
{{< link "docs/characters/companion-3" >}} is intrigued but seems to know a lot more than he lets on explaining things that he should not have any knowledge of.
They continue in and find what is explained to be a stasis pod that is nonfunctional and this is where the he starts becoming more cautious and shaken.
There are research notes nearby explaining that the creature that was in the pod was the “God” of the {{< link "docs/factions/theocracy" >}} and that it should not ever be released back into the world. 

The fourth party member is going to give some insight that the stasis pod contained a powerful entity and needs to be destroyed on sight.
The party is going to be let to believe that they were the true threat and that they are the God when in reality they are just a part of the God.
Once the part is destroyed by the party as their dying breath they will say something to indicate that there are others and prompts the party to go seek out the other.
