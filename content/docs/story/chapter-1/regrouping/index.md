{{< link "docs/characters/main" >}}, {{< link "docs/characters/companion-1" >}}, and {{< link "docs/characters/companion-2" >}} return to {{< link "docs/places/origin-city" >}} to show off what they have found which draws a lot of attention to the unique and useful things that they brought back from {{< link "docs/places/origin-ruins" >}}.
