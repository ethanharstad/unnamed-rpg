Ruins outside the city of {{< link "docs/places/origin-city" >}}.

The research station never runs out of power.
The station is siphoning the power from the creature in the stasis pod.
Damaging the transformer made it so that it could not keep up with the energy output of the God and the God started pulling the energy back into its body.
There are a lot of things using power in the research station, the main one being the stasis pod and also for a force field and holographic projector.
Since the dynamite damaged the transformer it is quickly dissipating the remaining power.
The goal of this station was to fully drain the God of its power and kill it that way.
